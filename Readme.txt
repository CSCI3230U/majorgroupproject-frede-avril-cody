The following is a twitter clone, which contains most of the important funcitionalites of
twitter. 

To run this application simply run a "git pull" from the repository to obtain the lastest code and an "npm i" to 
install all the nessacary dependecies
Once that is done you will need two terminals, one to run the server and one to run the front end.

you will need to "cd" into the server folder in the repo and the twitter_clone repo in different terminals 
hence the need for two terminals.

In the server folder run "nodemon" and in the twitter_clone folder run "npm start"

This will start your server and front end.

The login that can be used is 
Username: "Randy" 
password:"apple"

The feed will not display anything until you follow someone at the bottom right area.

In order to send someone a message you must enter the recipent for example "Paula" hit enter and type your message
and click send.
